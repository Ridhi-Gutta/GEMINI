# GEMINI

DREAM4 datasets are all time series

DREAM5 datasets are solid state

The DREAM5 mi_matrix_pairs.csv file and all E. coli data is too big to upload here.

All mutual information was obtained from a novel information theoretic algorithm (will be published here soon)

The data split of the e. coli notebook is different due to the fact that it crashes out when trained on the CPU
